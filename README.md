## Installation and running the app
In order to run the application, you need to run the api and client application separately

### Client
```
cd clientApp
npm install //install all dependencies
npm install -g @angular/cli // install angular cli globally
ng serve
```
This would run the angular app serve on port http://localhost:4200 by default.
** Make sure you install npm in your machine.

### API
```
cd API
dotnet run
```
This would run the angular app serve on port https://localhost:5500 by default.
** Make sure you install dotnet 6 in your machine.
